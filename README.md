For the CarController App.

Be sure to have Pyfirmata and Kivy installed in your computer. Additional info, mind that some installments may be placed in folders that aren't in your computers PATH and won't work as a result. 

Start by uploading the CarControllerAppStandardFirmata.ino to the Arduino. This initiates the board for the app and its functions in the CarControllerApp.py file.
Modify the CarControllerApp.py program as needed to refer to the COM port that you are using, afterwards you may run the program.
